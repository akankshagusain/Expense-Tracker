## 🖥️ How to Run the Expense Tracker

### 1. **Backend (Django API)**

1. **Open a terminal and navigate to your project folder.**

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (if not already done):**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install django djangorestframework djangorestframework-simplejwt
   ```

4. **Apply migrations:**
   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **(Optional) Create a superuser for admin access:**
   ```sh
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run the Django development server:**
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   The API will be available at: [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

### 2. **Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS, Chart.js)**

1. **Open the `frontend/index.html` file directly in your web browser.**
   - No build or server is needed for the frontend.
   - Make sure your Django backend is running.

---

### 3. **Usage**

- **Register a new user** (from the app’s login/register form).
- **Login** to access your dashboard.
- **Add, edit, or delete expenses** and see real-time updates and charts.
- **Logout** securely when done.

---

### 4. **Troubleshooting**

- If you get CORS errors, you may need to install and configure `django-cors-headers` in your Django project.
- Make sure the backend is running before using the frontend.
